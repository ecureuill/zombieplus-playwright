1. Long Title Validation Failure:
    - **Test**: Should not add movie with long title
    - **Description:** Attempting to create a movie with a title exceeding the allowed character limit results in an unexpected behavior.
2. Long Overview Validation Failure:
    - **Test**: Should not add movie with long overview
    - **Description:** Attempting to create a movie with a overview exceeding the allowed character limit results in an unexpected behavior.
3. Insufficient Special Character Validation:
    - **Test 1**: Should filter movie with special character title Test Movie with tab \t
    - **Test 2**: Should filter movie with special character title Test Movie with right-to-left mark \u200F
    - **Description**: The system failed to filter movies containing special characters in their titles.

## Playwright Project Configuration
In a Playwright test suite, project configuration is done using the `playwright.config.js` file. This file contains settings that affect how the tests are run and how the results are reported.

In this project, we have two separate projects defined within our Playwright configuration: `e2e tests` and `e2e home page tests`.

The reason for having separate projects is due to the fact that the tests in the home page alter the state of the database tables (movies, tvshows, and leads). To avoid any potential conflicts or race conditions, these tests are run separately from the rest of the tests. The `fullyParallel` property is set to `false` to ensure that the projects are run sequentially, not in parallel.

This configuration ensures that our tests are run in a controlled and predictable manner, minimizing the risk of unexpected behavior due to concurrent database modifications.

### Smoke Tests
In this project, we use the tag `@smoke` to define smoke tests. **Smoke tests** are a subset of the test suite that are designed to quickly verify that the basic functionality of the application is working correctly. They are often used as a first step in the testing process to catch any major issues before more detailed testing is performed.

### Special Character Testing for Movies

This project includes comprehensive tests that specifically focus on how the application handles movies with titles containing special characters. These tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including:

* Creating movies and TV shows with titles containing common special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %, &, !, *).
* Creating movies and TV shows with titles containing non-breaking spaces and other unusual characters.
* Searching for movies and TV shows with titles containing special characters.
* Verifying that special characters are displayed correctly in the UI.
* Verifying that special characters are stored correctly in the database.

These tests help ensure that the application can handle a wide range of input data and that special characters do not cause any unexpected behavior.


**Examples of tested special characters:**

- Emoji: üßü
- Extended ASCII characters: `√Ü √ê √û √± √¥`
- Newline character: `\n`
- Non-breaking space: ¬†
- Right-to-left mark: `\u200F`
- SQL special character: `
- HTML escape character: `<`
- Japanese characters: `„ÉÜ„Çπ„ÉàÊò†Áîª`


## Tech Stack and Their Roles

- **fixtures**: Stores reusable data and utility functions for test setup and execution.
- **tests**: Houses the actual test code, organized by components, pages, and specific features.
- **playwright.config.js**: Defines project-specific configuration for Playwright test execution.
- **node_modules**: Contains externally installed dependencies required by the project.
- **package.json**: Manages project metadata and dependencies.
- **tsconfig.json**: Configures TypeScript compilation and settings.

## Page Objects and Componentization
This project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. In POM, each page is represented by a class, and interactions with the page are encapsulated in the methods of that class.  This approach enhances the test code's:

- **Readability**: Clear object-oriented representation of pages and actions.
- **Reusability**: Shared page objects across tests, reducing code duplication.
- **Maintainability**: Modifications to page elements or interactions localized within the page object class.

In addition, this project makes extensive use of components, which are classes that encapsulate the interaction logic with specific parts of a page. For example, we have components for the search bar, the header, and the leads table. This further improves:

-  **Modularity**: Breaking down complex interactions into smaller, reusable components.
-  **Testability**: Isolating component behavior for focused testing.

## API Requests and DataBase queries

The database state is cleaned to ensure a consistent testing environment before each test. This is done using the `pg` package to interact directly with the PostgreSQL database.

In addition, some tests insert records into the database using the ZombiePlus API. This allows the tests to run quickly, without the need to interact with the user interface.

## Mutex
A mutex (or mutual exclusion) is used in this project to ensure that only one test can interact with the database at a time. This is necessary to avoid race conditions if multiple tests try to change the database at the same time.

## Test Data

The test data for this project is stored in separate files for each feature of the application. For example, the data for creating, deleting, and searching for leads is stored in the leads.json file, while the data for registering and managing movies is stored in the movies.json file.

Using separate files for each feature has several advantages. It makes the tests easier to write and maintain, as the test data can be updated in a single location for each feature. It also allows the tests to be run with a variety of data, which can reveal bugs that would not be discovered otherwise.

Moreover, this approach allows us to simulate different user behaviors and scenarios more realistically, contributing to more robust and reliable tests.

### Creating and Maintaining Test Data:

Test data creation involves identifying various use cases and edge cases relevant to each feature. Data is carefully crafted to represent expected user behavior, potential errors, and boundary conditions. The use of JSON files allows for easy editing and version control, facilitating updates as the application evolves.

By diligently maintaining and expanding the test data set, we ensure comprehensive coverage of various user interactions and system responses, strengthening the overall quality and reliability of the automated test suite.

### AI-Assisted Test Data Generation

This project leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to create and augment test data. Specifically, we utilize the capabilities of Gemini and ChatGPT to generate realistic and diverse data sets, including generate images for movie and TV show titles.

#### Benefits of AI-Assisted Test Data Generation:
- Increased Efficiency: AI-powered tools can significantly reduce the time and effort required to create and maintain test data.
- Enhanced Data Diversity: AI can generate a wider range of data than manual methods, covering a broader spectrum of use cases and edge cases.
- Improved Data Quality: AI tools can help identify and eliminate inconsistencies and errors in test data, ensuring higher data quality.
